"""Doctor command — run this when something feels wrong with worthless.

When to run ``worthless doctor``
---------------------------------

**"I get 401s even though I locked my key"**
  The proxy and your shell may be talking to different databases. This happens
  when ``WORTHLESS_HOME`` is set in one terminal but not another. Doctor will
  say "home mismatch" and tell you exactly which DB each side is using.

**"status says PROTECTED but wrap/unlock does nothing"**
  Your ``.env`` file was deleted or moved after the key was locked, leaving an
  orphan row in the DB. Doctor detects the dangling enrollment and ``--fix``
  removes it so you can lock a fresh key cleanly.

**"BASE_URL in my .env points somewhere but requests fail immediately"**
  The alias in ``OPENAI_BASE_URL`` (e.g. ``openai-abc12345``) has no matching
  shard in the current database. Doctor will name the alias and confirm it is
  absent. Common cause: locked in one home directory, running proxy from
  another.

**"OpenClaw stopped routing after I reinstalled the skill"**
  The OpenClaw skill folder drifted from what was wired at lock time. Doctor
  surfaces version mismatches and un-wired providers; ``--fix`` reinstalls the
  skill automatically.

**"I set up worthless on a second Mac and keys aren't available"** (macOS)
  Fernet keys synced via iCloud Keychain instead of staying local. Doctor
  finds them and ``--fix`` migrates them to local-only storage so the proxy
  can start without iCloud access.

**"I copied recovery files over from another Mac"** (macOS)
  Doctor automatically imports any ``*.recover`` files it finds in the
  recovery directory — no ``--fix`` flag needed.

Usage
-----
``worthless doctor``        — read-only scan, lists every issue found
``worthless doctor --fix``  — repair what can be repaired (prompts first)
``worthless doctor --yes``  — skip confirmation prompts (CI / scripted use)
``worthless doctor --dry-run`` — show planned repairs without writing anything

Design seams (foreseen extensions, not yet implemented):

* ``worthless-7db2`` (P3): partial-state recovery when the home dir is intact
  but the fernet key is missing from every source (manual keyring deletion).
* ``worthless-57ad`` (P3, post-v0.4): BYO-key LLM agent diagnoses unknown
  stuck states using a user-locked enrollment.
