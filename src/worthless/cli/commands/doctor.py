"""Doctor command — diagnose and repair stuck DB/.env states (HF7 / worthless-3907).

Currently handles TWO known shapes:

1. Orphan DB enrollments whose ``.env`` line was deleted by the user (HF7).
   The dogfood-discovered stuck state from 2026-04-30:

     worthless unlock -> "No enrolled keys found." (silently skips orphan)
     worthless status -> "Enrolled keys: ... PROTECTED" (lists the orphan)

2. OpenClaw integration drift (Phase 2.d / WOR-431): OpenClaw installed
   after ``worthless lock`` ran, or skill folder gone stale. Doctor
   surfaces skill version mismatches and un-wired providers, and can
   reinstall the skill when ``--fix`` is passed.

``worthless doctor`` is read-only: it lists issues.
``worthless doctor --fix`` repairs what it can (destructive for orphans,
safe for skill reinstall). Prompts unless ``--yes``. ``--dry-run`` shows
the planned action without writing.

Design seams (foreseen extensions, NOT in this PR):

* ``worthless-7db2`` (P3): a SECOND repair shape — partial-state recovery
  when the home dir is intact but the fernet key is missing from every
  source (manual keyring deletion). ``ensure_home`` will surface that
  state and point users here; doctor will need a key-regeneration flow
  guarded against silently destroying access to existing locked secrets.
* ``worthless-57ad`` (P3, post-v0.4): a BYO-key LLM agent diagnoses
  UNKNOWN stuck states using a user-locked enrollment.
