"""`worthless uninstall` (WOR-435) — restore every locked .env, then wipe.

Assembles existing primitives rather than duplicating crypto:
- enumerate locked .env files via ``ShardRepository.list_enrollments`` (each
  carries the ``original_mode`` captured by ``lock`` per WOR-715);
- reconstruct + restore each key reusing ``unlock``'s ``_unlock_batch``;
- restore the original file mode, clamped to owner-only (``secure_restore_mode``),
  informing the user when a loose mode was tightened (human gets asked);
- wipe keychain + ``~/.worthless`` — but ONLY after every restore succeeds
  (the restore-ALL-then-wipe key-shredder guard: a wipe that runs after a
  failed restore would delete shard-B while the real key was never put back).
