"""WOR-753: static fix playbooks, one per doctor ``check_id``.

AI-less and deterministic — these ship in the wheel and are read offline
(no LLM, no API key, no network). ``runner._stamp_remediation`` attaches
them to each finding of a failing check, and ``worthless doctor --explain
<check_id>`` prints them. ``fernet_drift``'s playbook is its existing
``_INSTRUCTIONS`` so there is a single source of truth — do not copy it.
