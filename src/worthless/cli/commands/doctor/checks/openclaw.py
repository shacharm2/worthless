"""WOR-464 / WOR-515: OpenClaw integration drift check + secrets audit gate.

JSON-mode reporter for:
- Integration drift (skill install, provider enrollment) — WOR-464
- Audit gate state: plaintext keys (exit-73 state) and binary failures
  (exit-87 state) — WOR-515 AC 10. Surfaces exactly what ``worthless lock``
  would reject, so users can remediate before attempting to lock.

``--fix`` is not yet wired here — repair requires a TTY
(``openclaw secrets configure`` prompts interactively per M0 findings).
