"""WOR-464: doctor JSON-mode runner.

The text-mode runner (`_doctor_run` in the package `__init__.py`) stays
byte-identical to v0.3.6's output. JSON mode is wired here so any future
``--json``-specific behaviour does not bleed into the text path.

Contract:
  Exactly ONE ``typer.echo(json.dumps(...))`` call. No other prints.
  Logging goes to stderr per Python logging defaults; tests assert
  stdout is parseable JSON.
