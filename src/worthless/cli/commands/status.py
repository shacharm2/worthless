"""Status command — show enrolled keys and proxy health.

Trust-fix (2026-05-08 verification gauntlet): also reads
``$WORTHLESS_HOME/last-lock-status.json``. When the sentinel reports
DEGRADED state (lock-core succeeded but the OpenClaw integration stage
failed), status emits a ``[WARN]`` row AND exits non-zero so the
"five-minute-later" trust failure mode is closed: a stale terminal
session that swallowed the original ``lock`` exit code still gets
told the truth on the next ``worthless status`` invocation.
