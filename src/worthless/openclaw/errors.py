"""Stable error codes + event objects for the OpenClaw integration.

The string values of :class:`OpenclawErrorCode` are wire-format: they
appear in ``worthless lock --json`` / ``worthless doctor --json`` output
and are consumed by Pi (the JSON parser referenced in spec AC6). Renaming
a value is a breaking change for downstream agents — extend, don't rename.

The :class:`OpenclawIntegrationEvent` dataclass is frozen so events
appended to a sink in lock-core can't be mutated by later stages before
``--json`` renders them.

for Phase 2.a" and the failure-mode tables F01–F47.
