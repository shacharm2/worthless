    v1.1 implementation: :class:`worthless.sidecar.backends.fernet.FernetBackend`.
    v2.0 will add KMS and MPC backends; the sidecar server talks only to
    this interface so backends are swappable without touching server code.

    All methods are async to allow future backends to do I/O (KMS calls,
    MPC rounds). The Fernet backend implements them synchronously under
    the hood but keeps the async signature.

    Subclasses MUST declare :attr:`caps` listing the verbs they support.
    The sidecar server derives both the wire-level handshake advertisement
    AND the dispatch allowlist from this tuple, so a backend that does not
    advertise a verb cannot have that verb dispatched against it \u2014 even
    if the method exists on the class. This defends against future v2.0
    backends silently accepting verbs they have not implemented (WOR-465 A3a
    defense-in-depth).
