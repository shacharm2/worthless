"""Linux-side process hardening for the Fernet sidecar (WOR-310 Phase A).

Two primitives, both invoked by ``__main__.main()`` ahead of any share
load or socket bind:

* :func:`set_dumpable_zero` — calls ``prctl(PR_SET_DUMPABLE, 0)`` so the
  kernel refuses ptrace from non-parent processes regardless of YAMA and
  refuses to write a core dump if the process crashes mid-decrypt.
  Linux-only; silent no-op on Darwin/Windows.

* :func:`check_yama_ptrace_scope` — verifies
  ``/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope >= 1``. Value ``0`` permits any
  same-uid process to attach via ``ptrace``, defeating the
  proxy-can't-read-sidecar-memory invariant on bare metal. Raises
  ``WorthlessError(YAMA_PTRACE_SCOPE_TOO_LOW)`` on ``0``; treats missing
  or malformed file as warn-pass (Mac dev path, custom kernels).

Both are stdlib-only and avoid touching any cryptographic state.

      on every kernel (verified absent on Linux 6.9.12 — observed in

      portable kernel API.
    * **NoNewPrivs**: parsed from ``/proc/self/status``. Linux has
      no portable ``prctl(PR_GET_NO_NEW_PRIVS)`` query, so procfs is
      the only option for this bit; it has been exposed on every
      supported kernel back to 3.5.

    Mode gating (``WORTHLESS_DOCKER_PRIVDROP_REQUIRED``):

    * **Docker two-uid mode** (env=1): both ``NoNewPrivs=1`` and
      ``Dumpable=0`` are required — the parent's ``preexec_fn`` set
      both before exec, and either being absent means the kernel
      silently dropped a security primitive.
    * **Bare-metal / dev mode** (env unset): only ``Dumpable=0`` is
      required. ``set_no_new_privs`` is never called in this path
      (NNP is a preexec_fn-only primitive — once we ``exec()`` python
      it would be too late and would also break test infrastructure
      that relies on subprocess.Popen). Asserting NNP=1 here would
      refuse every legitimate bare-metal sidecar boot.
