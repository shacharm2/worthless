"""Durable write-ahead spend ledger (WOR-659).

A request HOLDs its estimated cost in ``pending_charges`` before the upstream
call, then SETTLEs to the actual amount after. A crash between hold and settle
leaves the hold standing — it counts against the cap (fail-closed) and is reaped
by :meth:`sweep` at its own estimate, never lost.

All SQL runs on the INJECTED connection (never a fresh ``aiosqlite.connect``) so
it inherits ``busy_timeout`` and serialises with the proxy's other writes.
