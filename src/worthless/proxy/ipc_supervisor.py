"""Connection lifecycle + backpressure + reconnect supervisor over IPCClient.

This module wraps the low-level :class:`worthless.ipc.client.IPCClient` with
the operational policy the proxy needs:

* eager connect at startup (lifespan), fail-loud if sidecar is unreachable;
* a single :class:`asyncio.Lock` guarding state transitions (no per-state locks);
* an :class:`asyncio.Semaphore` capping in-flight ops (default 32);
* atomic ``acquire()`` context manager (semaphore + ready client + release);
* fast-fail if the semaphore can't be entered within 100 ms → 503;
* protocol-version + capability check on every (re)connect — caps shrinking
  across reconnects is fatal (security restoration C3 in
  ``.research/10-security-signoff.md``);
* explicit ``aclose()`` with a 5 s in-flight ceiling (security restoration C2).

Design invariants kept here:

* No fallback. Transport failure raises :class:`IPCUnavailable`. The proxy
  HTTP layer maps that to HTTP 503 (``engineering/ipc-contract.md`` §invariants).
* No crypto here. The supervisor is intentionally crypto-agnostic — it owns
  *transport policy*, not key material. Plaintext returned by ``open()`` is
  surfaced as a :class:`bytearray` so callers can zero it (SR-01).
* DRAINING is a flag, not a state. The 4-state FSM is
  ``DISCONNECTED → CONNECTING → READY → CLOSED``; ``aclose()`` flips
  ``_draining = True`` on the side, refuses new ``acquire()``, awaits in-flight
  with a 5 s ceiling, then transitions to CLOSED (see code-review §2 in
  ``.research/08-code-review.md``).

Backoff between reconnects is jittered (CSPRNG only, SR-08):

* retry 1: random(10 ms, 50 ms);
* retry 2: random(50 ms, 250 ms);
* retry N>2: ``min(1000ms, 250ms * 2**(N-2)) + random ±20%``.
