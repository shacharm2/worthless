"""Run an async coroutine to completion from a sync caller, regardless of
whether an event loop is already running.

Plain ``asyncio.run`` raises ``RuntimeError`` when invoked from a context
that already has a running loop (MCP server lazy bootstrap, pytest-asyncio
embeddings, etc). This helper probes for a live loop and tunnels through
a thread when one is found, so sync entry points that need a single async
roundtrip do not crash inside reusable code.

    """Drive ``coro`` to completion and return its result.

    If the calling thread already has a running event loop, the coroutine
    is dispatched to a daemon worker thread that runs ``asyncio.run`` in a
    fresh loop; otherwise ``asyncio.run`` is invoked directly on the
    current thread.

    This function is thread-safe; concurrent callers each get their own
    worker thread and event loop.

    The threaded path uses a daemon ``threading.Thread`` rather than a
    ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` so that a timed-out worker does not register
    an ``atexit`` hook blocking process exit. On timeout the caller
    receives ``concurrent.futures.TimeoutError`` immediately; the daemon
    worker continues running until the coroutine finishes naturally
    (Python cannot kill threads) and is reaped by the interpreter on
    process exit. CLI callers can safely rely on ``timeout``; long-running
    services should still avoid coroutines that ignore cancellation.

    Exceptions propagate to the caller unchanged.
