# Worthless

**Make leaked API keys worthless.**

When your `.env` leaks, the keys inside are placeholders. The real key never sits in your repo, your shell history, or your laptop's memory.

## Quickstart

```bash
curl -sSL https://worthless.sh | sh        # fresh machine, no Python needed
# or, if you already have Python 3.10+:
pipx install worthless
```

Then `cd` into your project and run `worthless`. It detects keys in your `.env`, splits them, starts a local proxy. No code changes.

The Worker emits an `X-Worthless-Script-Sha256` header so you can [verify the bytes you ran match the bytes the Worker advertised](https://docs.wless.io/install-security/) before piping into `sh`. The check catches transit/cache tampering, not origin compromise — cosign-signed release manifests for that are tracked in [WOR-303](https://linear.app/plumbusai/issue/WOR-303).

Full install options (Docker, MCP for Claude Code / Cursor / Windsurf, GitHub Actions, the verified-install flow, kill-switch runbook): **[docs.wless.io](https://docs.wless.io)**

## How it works

1. `worthless lock` splits each API key into two shards
2. Shard A stays on your machine (encrypted). Shard B goes to the proxy database
3. Your `.env` is rewritten with shard A — format-preserving, but cryptographically useless alone
4. The proxy reconstructs the key only when the rules engine approves the request
5. Spend cap blown? The key never forms. The request never reaches the provider

## Platforms

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| macOS | Supported |
| Linux | Supported |
| Windows + WSL | Supported |
| Native Windows | Not supported — use WSL or Docker |

Native-Windows support is tracked in [WOR-237](https://linear.app/plumbusai/issue/WOR-237). See [docs.wless.io](https://docs.wless.io) for the full distro support matrix.

## Versioning

PyPI version, signed git tag (`vX.Y.Z`), and the `X-Worthless-Script-Tag` header on `worthless.sh` are kept aligned — CI fails fast if `pyproject.toml` and the tag disagree. `install.sh` resolves the latest `worthless` from PyPI at install time; pin via `WORTHLESS_VERSION=x.y.z curl -sSL https://worthless.sh | sh`.

## Documentation

Everything lives at **[docs.wless.io](https://docs.wless.io)** — install guides, the security model, wire protocol, recovery runbook, the verified-install flow, and the agent skill file (Claude Code / Cursor / Windsurf).

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shacharm2/worthless && cd worthless
uv sync --extra dev --extra test
uv run pytest
```
