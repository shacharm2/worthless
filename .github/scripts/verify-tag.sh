# Fatal GPG-tag verification with fingerprint pinning + multi-key armor
# rejection. WOR-323.
#
# Reads from environment:
#   MAINTAINER_PUBKEY      — ASCII-armored public key (repo Variable)
#   MAINTAINER_FINGERPRINT — 40-char hex fingerprint (repo Variable)
#   GITHUB_REF_NAME        — tag to verify (set automatically by GHA)
#
# Defense layers (each fails closed):
#   1. Both Variables must be set.
#   2. Fingerprint must normalize to exactly 40 hex chars.
#   3. Pubkey must import successfully into a fresh GNUPGHOME.
#   4. Imported keyring must contain exactly one primary key (rejects
#      multi-key armor decoy attack — see WOR-323 expert review).
#   5. Imported key's fingerprint must match the pinned fingerprint.
#   6. `git verify-tag` must succeed against the single-key keyring.
#
# What this DOES NOT defend against:
#   - A full Variable-swap by an attacker who can write BOTH Variables
#     atomically. The fingerprint pin and multi-key rejection raise the
#     bar (each Variable change shows up in the GitHub audit log) but
#     are not cryptographic defense against repo-admin compromise.
#     See workers/worthless-sh/DEPLOY.md §"Known residual risks".
#
# Single source of truth — called from both `verify` and `deploy` jobs
# in deploy-worker.yml so the deploy job re-verifies independently
# rather than transitively trusting the verify job's outputs. Tested
# by .github/scripts/test-verify-tag-multikey.sh (run on every PR via
# .github/workflows/verify-tag-test.yml).
