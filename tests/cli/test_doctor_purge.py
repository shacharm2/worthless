"""HF7 / worthless-3907: ``worthless doctor --fix`` purges orphan DB rows.

Five tests that pin the HF7 contract. Phrase-token contract (plain English,
not engineer jargon — the user does NOT think "I have an orphan"):

  ``can't restore``           — the problem (replaces engineer-speak "orphan")
  ``worthless doctor --fix``  — the solution (the command name)

Both required-via-AND, not OR-of-variants. The OR-of-five-variants form
was the false-positive class HF4/PR #123 caught: pytest's ``tmp_path``
embeds the test name and ``"orphan"`` matched any path-echoing error.
