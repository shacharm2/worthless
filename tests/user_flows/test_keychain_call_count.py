"""Seed user-flow test: real keyring + real CLI = 1 ``keyring.get_password``
per ``worthless lock``.

THIS IS the test pattern for ``@pytest.mark.user_flow``. THIS IS NOT a
mocked unit test — it spies on the actual ``keyring`` module while a real
CLI invocation runs. The full user-flow suite (install / uninstall /
multi-platform Docker matrix) is tracked under bead ``worthless-bwu6``.

Why this lives here, not in ``tests/test_bootstrap_keyring.py``:

* Unit tests mock ``read_fernet_key`` entirely — they only verify the
  cache mechanism. The HF2 PR #125 ``migrate_file_to_keyring`` bypass
  fired ``keyring.get_password`` directly, completely bypassing the
  property and its cache. All unit tests passed; the bug shipped to
  review and was caught only when a manual spy on a real CLI run on
  2026-05-03 showed 2 calls instead of 1.

* User-flow tests run the real CLI against a real keyring and spy at
  the boundary. They are slow (touch real backends), require platform-
  appropriate keyring infrastructure (skipped if absent), and may
  prompt the user on macOS without 'Always Allow' set up.

* Default pytest run excludes the ``user_flow`` marker. Opt-in:
  ``pytest -m user_flow``.

    """One ``keyring.get_password`` per ``worthless lock`` on the existing-key
    path — the HF2 contract.

    Pattern:
      1. First ``lock`` provisions the keyring entry (first-ever-boot path,
         not what we're measuring).
      2. Second ``lock`` runs against the existing keyring entry. THIS is
         the path we spy on.
      3. Assert ``keyring.get_password`` was called exactly once during the
         second run.

    Without the HF2 fixes (cache + ``migrate_file_to_keyring`` reorder),
    the second run fires 2 calls: one from the property's probe and one
    from ``migrate_file_to_keyring`` checking "is the key already in
    keyring?". This test catches that regression without monkey-patching.
