"""HF7 dogfood scenario as a single chained user-flow test.

Closes the test gap surfaced during HF7 review: ``test_doctor_purge.py``
verifies isolated commands (lock alone, doctor alone, unlock alone), but
the bug from 2026-04-30 was an INTEGRATION shape across four commands.
This test runs the full chain and asserts each step, so a regression in
ANY of (status, unlock, doctor, post-fix consistency) gets caught.

The chain:

  1. lock      — enroll a key in the DB + rewrite .env to shard-A
  2. status    — confirms 1 PROTECTED enrollment
  3. (user manually deletes the .env line — the dogfood trigger)
  4. unlock    — must surface canonical wording with the fix command
  5. status    — STILL lists PROTECTED (the surprising part the user reported)
  6. doctor    — diagnose-mode: lists the broken row, exit 0, DB unchanged
  7. doctor --fix --yes — purges; success message
  8. status    — finally consistent: 0 enrolled keys

This file uses ``WORTHLESS_HOME=tmp_path/...`` so it does NOT touch the
developer's actual ``~/.worthless/``. It DOES exercise the real keyring
backend (or real file fallback if no keyring), real SQLite, real Typer
command dispatch — the same way the user-flow seed test
``test_keychain_call_count.py`` does for HF2.

Marked ``user_flow`` so the default test sweep skips it.
