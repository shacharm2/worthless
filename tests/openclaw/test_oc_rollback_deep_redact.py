"""WOR-621 F2 G5-B (Gap 2a) — deep-redact ``build_oc_rollback_entry_record``.

RED-first. The threat: today ``build_oc_rollback_entry_record`` is a
shallow-copy + top-level ``apiKey`` substitution. So a user with a custom
OpenClaw provider entry that carries credentials in a NON-canonical field
(e.g. ``headers.Authorization: "Bearer sk-..."`` for a self-hosted gateway
that wants a raw bearer header rather than the auto-injected ``apiKey``,
or any nested config field a user added) ships their real key verbatim
into ``oc_original_api_key_json`` AND has it written back into
``openclaw.json`` on restore. The G3+G4 panel (Jenny) flagged this as
Gap 2a: the docstring claims "key-redacted full entry record" but only
top-level ``apiKey`` is touched.

The defense: walk the captured entry recursively (dicts AND lists) and
replace any string that ``KEY_PATTERN`` flags as key-shaped with a
``{"kind": "redacted-deep"}`` sentinel. The user has to re-paste those
nested credentials on unlock — but they were never safe in the rollback
record anyway.

Pinned contracts (RED):

1. A key-shaped string at depth >=2 in the captured entry is replaced by
   the sentinel dict in the resulting JSON.
2. A key-shaped string inside a nested list is also replaced.
3. Multiple key-shaped strings in one entry are all replaced.
4. A plain non-key string (URL, description) is preserved verbatim.
5. The existing top-level ``apiKey`` redaction path is unchanged (a
   plaintext apiKey → ``{"kind":"plaintext"}``; a dict apiKey →
   ``{"kind":"secretref","ref":<verbatim ref>}``).
6. The redacted record round-trips: ``_parse_oc_rollback_entry_record``
   accepts it without raising.

The sentinel is intentionally a dict (not a string like ``"<REDACTED>"``)
to make the contract unambiguous on the restore side: an attempt to
write a dict where the user had a string is loud and self-documenting,
not silent partial leakage.
