"""F8 (WOR-658) — bind-confirmation after lock.

Threat: lock today can print [OK] and exit 0 even when the rewritten
OpenClaw provider entry still routes to the upstream API directly — the
silent-bypass class that bit WOR-514. The user sees a green checkmark and
believes the proxy is in the path; the next OpenClaw agent turn leaks the
real key anyway.

What this pins: after lock-core succeeds at rewriting the OpenClaw entry,
lock must send a synthetic request through the rewritten config and observe
the proxy's ``requests_proxied`` counter increment. The result is persisted
to ``$WORTHLESS_HOME/last-lock-status.json`` so ``worthless status`` /
``worthless doctor`` can report "locked AND routing", not just "locked."

When the counter doesn't tick, lock refuses to claim success: it exits
non-zero and the sentinel records the failure.

Spec: WOR-621 plan §F8 / PR-2, AC10 (first half).
