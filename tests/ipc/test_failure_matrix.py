"""Failure-matrix tests for the IPC sidecar.

WOR-307 Day 3 deliverable: prove the no-fallback contract holds under
every realistic sidecar failure mode, not just the happy path.

The contract (``engineering/ipc-contract.md`` §No-fallback, §Errors): every
failure path surfaces as a typed :class:`worthless.ipc.client.IPCError`
subclass. The proxy layer above translates each to HTTP 503. There is
NO in-process crypto fallback — that is the entire point of the sidecar.

Scenarios covered here (each must raise a typed ``IPCError`` and leak
neither plaintext nor key material):

1. Connect to missing socket          → IPCProtocolError
2. Connect to stale socket file       → IPCProtocolError (connect refuses)
3. Op after transport forcibly closed → IPCProtocolError (proxy-side socket died)
4. Reconnect after server shutdown    → IPCProtocolError (no in-process fallback)
5. Backend failure mid-op             → IPCBackendError (code=BACKEND)
6. Backend-error message scrubbed     → wire err is the fixed generic string
7. Client has zero in-process crypto  → static import check

See also ``test_roundtrip.py::test_client_timeout_raises_ipc_timeout_error_fast``
which covers the deadline path (row 7 of WOR-306 decision matrix).

Note on row 3: ``asyncio.Server.close()`` on Python <3.12 stops accepting
new connections but leaves established connections alive. We therefore
simulate "transport dies mid-session" by force-closing the client's
writer — the observable behavior (next op raises a typed error, no
fallback to local crypto) is identical to a real sidecar SIGKILL as
far as the client contract is concerned.
