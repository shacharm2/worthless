"""WOR-309 Phase 5 slice 5.6 — strict concurrency / no-crosstalk tests.

The pre-existing ``test_32_concurrent_requests_distinct_responses`` in
``test_proxy_client_unit.py`` proves the supervisor *completes* 32 calls
without protocol errors, but the fake sidecar there returns a canned
``FAKE-PT`` regardless of input. That demonstrates "no errors", not "no
crosstalk" — a swapped reply id would silently land on the wrong
coroutine and the canned body would mask it.

This module exercises a stricter contract: the fake echoes each
ciphertext back as the plaintext, and we assert every coroutine
receives the *exact* bytes it submitted. That is the real no-crosstalk
property the supervisor's outer Semaphore + IPCClient inner Lock claim
to provide.

Two tests:

* ``test_32_coroutines_payload_distinct`` — 32 concurrent ``open``
  calls with unique payloads; assert each coroutine receives its own
  payload back.
* ``test_no_protocol_framing_interleave`` — same shape, but with the
  fake configured to delay replies; if two responses ever interleaved
  on the wire we'd see truncated frames or id mismatches surface as
  ``IPCProtocolError``.

Both tests share the in-process ``fake_sidecar`` fixture and configure
``handle.echo_ciphertext = True`` (added in this slice) to opt in to
payload-echo behaviour.
