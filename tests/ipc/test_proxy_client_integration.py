"""WOR-309 Phase 5 slice 5.7 — GREEN integration tests against a real sidecar subprocess.

Tests #14-15 from ``.research/04-test-plan.md``. Both spawn the actual
``python -m worthless.sidecar`` binary via the ``subprocess_sidecar``
fixture and exercise the wire protocol end-to-end. Slow — kept tight.

Marked ``integration`` so the default test run can opt in/out per the
pyproject markers list. ``real_ipc`` opts out of the autouse Fake
supervisor injection (the proxy app is never built here, but the marker
keeps these tests on the same opt-out lane as the rest of the
"real subprocess" suite).
