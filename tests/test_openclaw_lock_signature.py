"""OpenClaw + lock insulation tests (worthless-7sl9).

The scan --code work explicitly does NOT touch lock.py or openclaw/*.
These tests are the tripwire that proves it stays that way:

- ``apply_lock`` signature is pinned (kwarg names + return type).
- ``worthless lock --help`` does not expose any --code option.
- Lock end-to-end never invokes the new scanner.
- A self-scan of the openclaw skill assets produces zero findings
  (sanity: OpenClaw itself does not contain any provider URLs that
  would self-trigger the rule).
