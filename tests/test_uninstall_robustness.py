"""`worthless uninstall` ROBUSTNESS contract (WOR-713 PR2) — RED-first TDD.

Live "fuck around and find out" found two real bugs the existing 23
``tests/test_uninstall.py`` tests miss. These tests encode the operator's
decisions as the contract; the implementation lands AFTER this file, so every
test here is expected to FAIL (RED) until then.

The two bugs, and the decisions that fix them:

BUG-1 — A BROKEN INSTALL CANNOT BE REMOVED.
    With ``.bootstrapped`` present but ``fernet.key`` deleted (or
    ``worthless.db`` corrupted), opening the repo raises ``WRTLS-102`` (no
    Fernet key) / a DB error, and ``uninstall`` refuses — so a half-dead
    install is un-removable. Decision: WITHOUT ``--force`` refuse cleanly and
    tell the user to re-run with ``--force`` (never a WRTLS-199 crash); WITH
    ``--force`` wipe the remains anyway, warning that keys could not be
    restored.

BUG-2 — A DELETED PROJECT (.env gone) ABORTS UNINSTALL FOREVER.
    An enrollment row whose ``.env`` file was deleted is indistinguishable, to
    the current key-shredder guard, from a restore that FAILED (real risk).
    So uninstall aborts (``WRTLS-103, nothing wiped``) and can never finish.
    Decision: a MISSING ``.env`` (nothing to lose) is a skip+warn, NOT a block
    — the wipe still runs. A restore that genuinely FAILS (``.env`` present,
    reconstruction raised) still blocks WITHOUT ``--force`` and is overridden
    WITH ``--force``.

These map to the seam the docstring of ``uninstall._run_uninstall`` already
names: "if any .env can't be restored, nothing is wiped". The fix has to make
that guard distinguish "file missing" from "restore failed", and add a
``--force`` escape hatch for the broken-repo and failed-restore paths.
