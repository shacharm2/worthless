# Verify install.sh is idempotent: a second `curl … | sh` must produce the
# same on-disk state as the first. No version bump, no re-downloaded wheels,
# no binary-hash drift. Exits 0 on match, 1 on diff (with the diff in stdout).
#
# Why this matters: people put `curl … | sh` in CI bootstraps and Dockerfiles.
# A non-idempotent installer turns every job into a wheel re-download and
# a tool-dir rewrite, slows builds, and risks pulling a newer (untested)
# version mid-pipeline.
