"""`worthless doctor` must DIAGNOSE the un-removable broken states (WOR-713 PR2).

RED-first. ``doctor`` is the operator's escape hatch: when ``uninstall`` refuses
a broken install (BUG-1) or has to skip an orphaned enrollment (BUG-2), the user
needs ``doctor`` to (a) name the problem and (b) point at the fix —
``worthless uninstall --force``.

Two diagnoses are required:

7a. ``fernet.key`` MISSING while enrollments exist (the BUG-1 broken install).
    Today ``doctor --json`` reads ``read_fernet_key(home.base_dir)`` at the top
    of ``_doctor_run_json`` BEFORE any check runs, so on a key-missing home the
    command itself crashes (WRTLS-102) — doctor can't even diagnose the state it
    exists to diagnose. The ``fernet_drift`` check only fires when BOTH a keyring
    entry AND a file are present and differ, so a flat-out MISSING key with live
    enrollments is currently un-surfaced. The fix must report it and recommend
    ``worthless uninstall --force``.

7b. ORPHANED enrollments — ``env_path`` set but the file is gone (the BUG-2
    deleted-project state). The ``orphan_db`` check already FINDS these; this
    test additionally pins that the recommendation surfaced for them includes
    ``worthless uninstall --force`` as a way to get fully unstuck (not only the
    surgical ``doctor --fix`` purge).

The implementation (a new check, or extending the existing ones) is the
operator's call — these tests assert the OBSERVABLE JSON contract, not a
specific check_id, so either approach can turn them green.
