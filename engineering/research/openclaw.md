## TL;DR

OpenClaw is a real, MIT-licensed, multi-channel AI gateway daemon (npm `openclaw`,
`ghcr.io/openclaw/openclaw`). Users install skills via a separate CLI called
`clawhub`. The crowd-favorite install path for worthless is **one command**:
`clawhub install worthless`. Today that command 404s — the skill is not yet
published. Everything between "user types the command" and "user gets a
protected API call" is unbuilt; the proxy + openclaw.json baseUrl path
underneath has been working since WOR-213.

## What OpenClaw is

A self-hosted Node.js gateway that connects messaging channels (Discord,
WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, iMessage, Matrix, Teams, Signal, etc.) to AI agents.
One daemon, many channels, an in-house agent ("Pi") that can call skills.
Skills are folders of markdown + YAML frontmatter (`SKILL.md`) that declare
required CLI bins; the agent shells out to those bins using `--json` output.
Different product from Claude Code, but adopted Anthropic's open SKILL.md
"Agent Skills" spec — that's why the schema looks familiar.

## Verified evidence

| Source | Evidence | Verified |
|---|---|---|
| npm `openclaw@2026.5.3-1` | 53.6 MB, 141 versions, MIT, `bin: openclaw`, repo github.com/openclaw/openclaw | direct probe |
| npm `clawhub@0.12.2` | CLI: `install <slug>`, `search`, `skill publish`, browser-OAuth login | `clawhub --help` locally |
| `ghcr.io/openclaw/openclaw:latest` | Multi-arch OCI image, version 2026.5.3-1, source github.com/openclaw/openclaw, built 2026-05-04 | `docker pull` + `docker inspect` |
| `tests/openclaw/docker-compose.yml` | Worthless × OpenClaw e2e stack working today | merged in WOR-213 |
| `tests/openclaw/openclaw-config/openclaw.json` | Real openclaw.json schema we route via | shipped in repo |

---

## Integration paths, ranked by friction

| Rank | Path | Commands | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `clawhub install worthless` | 1 | Default for OpenClaw users (when skill is published) |
| 2 | Sideload from a GitHub URL | 1 (`clawhub install <github-url>`) | Pre-publish testing; users on patched forks |
| 3 | Manual: pull image, edit `openclaw.json` baseUrl, restart gateway | 4+ | Contributor / debug only — never in user-facing docs |

"Just ask OpenClaw to install it" via chat is technically possible but slower
and chicken-and-egg (requires the skill to already exist on ClawHub). Not a
real path.

## Corrections after deep-dive research (supersede earlier sections)

After per-child deep-dives in WOR-430/431/432/433, three claims in this doc were
wrong or incomplete. The newer research files supersede this section if they
disagree.

1. **OpenClaw does NOT expose OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions`.** Port
   18789 serves the Control SPA only — `POST /v1/chat/completions` returns 404.
   The headless test harness for skills is `openclaw agent --local --json
   --message …` invoked via `docker exec`. The earlier Integration-paths table
   implied a direct HTTP API; that's wrong. See
   `openclaw-WOR-432-e2e-design.md`.

2. **No GitHub-URL sideload for skills.** `clawhub install` accepts only `<slug>`
   + `--version`. GitHub-source publish is a *package*-only feature, not skills.
   The Plan B fallback if registry publish blocks is `git clone` + manual copy
   into `~/.openclaw/skills/`. See `openclaw-WOR-433-publish-flow.md`.

3. **Skills have no appeal process if the scanner flags.** Only `clawhub skill
   rescan <slug>` (rate-limited). Packages have a full appeal/report/triage
   surface; skills don't. Risk on registry publish is higher than this doc
   originally implied. See `openclaw-WOR-433-publish-flow.md`.

Other findings worth promoting from the per-child files:

- `clawhub skill publish` has **no `--dry-run`** (only `sync` does). We can't
  preview the scanner verdict before going live.
- Local CLI does zero security scanning; all scans are server-side post-upload.
- Publishing implicitly **MIT-0**-licenses uploaded files. Confirm with legal
  before launch.
- Existing security skills published cleanly: `steipete/1password`,
  `kmjones1979/1claw`, `asleep123/bitwarden` — precedent for credential-handling
  exists.
- Skill bind-mount path inside container: `/home/node/.openclaw/skills/<name>/`.

## Critical product decisions (lock before code)

These apply regardless of OpenClaw — any chat-agent + spend-cap integration hits
them. Adversarial research surfaced concrete prior-art failures for each.

1. **Fail-open vs fail-closed when proxy unreachable.** LiteLLM had to retrofit
   this post-launch (PR #9533). Default position must be explicit.
2. **Mid-stream cap-hit behavior.** Pi may already be streaming a reply when
   cap trips. Decide: kill stream + error code, or finish-then-block-next.
3. **Atomic increment-and-check on spend cap.** Naïve pre-check + post-record
   races: 3 parallel sub-agent calls all pass pre-check, all reconstruct, all
   exceed cap. Required: atomic Redis increment.
4. **`key_known_dead` cache on upstream 401s.** Otherwise each retry burns KMS
   calls + meter cycles for a key the provider has revoked.
5. **Non-retryable error code on `cap_exceeded`.** Hypothesis: agents will loop
   on a generic 403 and burn context. Needs an error-code semantics experiment
   against Claude Code / Cursor / OpenClaw before launch.

## Phase scope (under everything-claude-code)

If WOR-94's parent ticket is filed today, realistic ~2–3 days end-to-end:

| Step | Owner agent | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| Author skill folder (`SKILL.md` + frontmatter + install hook) | `architect` + manual | `skills/worthless/` in repo, lints with `clawhub` |
| Install hook writes `models.providers.<x>.baseUrl` to openclaw.json | `tdd-guide` enforces tests-first | host-side hook script |
| Decide + document 5 product questions above | `security-reviewer` | ADR in `engineering/adr/` |
| End-to-end test: `clawhub install worthless` → first message → protected | `e2e-runner` adapts existing compose | `tests/test_openclaw_skill_e2e.py` |
| Publish to ClawHub | manual | `clawhub login && clawhub skill publish ./skills/worthless` |
| Update `docs/install.html` OpenClaw panel to single-command | `doc-updater` | install page truthful |

Risks: `clawhub` may have an automated dangerous-code scanner that flags
key-handling skills (per [clawhub#669](https://github.com/openclaw/clawhub/issues/669)
— flagged but unverified). Sideload via GitHub URL works if publish blocks.

---

## Open questions (need experiments, not reasoning)

1. Does `models.providers.*.baseUrl` hot-reload on `openclaw.json` change, or
   does the gateway need restart? Test: edit baseUrl mid-conversation, send a
   message, observe.
2. Does `clawhub install <slug>` run skill install hooks unattended on Linux
   (CLI install) or only via the macOS Skills UI? Docs imply UI-only.
3. Does Pi loop on `403 cap_exceeded` from worthless? Test: trigger the cap,
   observe Pi's retry behavior.
4. Multi-user identity: gateway does NOT pass normalized sender ID to tools
   (channel-prefixed: `telegram:123`, `whatsapp:+15551234567`). Does the
   worthless skill need to read inbound sender for per-user spend, or is that
   v1.x scope?
5. Does ClawHub publish require an organization account, or does any logged-in
   user with a verified email work? Test: `clawhub login` from a throwaway.

## Phase 2 implementation notes (WOR-431, 2026-05-08)

### What shipped

Phase 2 (branch `feature/wor-421-openclaw-research-doc`) delivered the full
magic-UX integration: `worthless lock` silently wires OpenClaw, `worthless unlock`
cleans it up, `worthless doctor` surfaces drift, and `worthless status` persists
DEGRADED state across terminal sessions.

**New modules:**

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/worthless/openclaw/integration.py` | `detect()`, `apply_lock()`, `apply_unlock()` |
| `src/worthless/openclaw/skill.py` | `install()`, `uninstall()`, `current_version()` |
| `src/worthless/openclaw/errors.py` | `OpenclawErrorCode`, `OpenclawIntegrationEvent`, `OpenclawIntegrationReport` |
| `src/worthless/openclaw/skill_assets/SKILL.md` | Embedded skill file shipped in the wheel |
| `src/worthless/cli/sentinel.py` | Atomic JSON sentinel for trust-fix persistent DEGRADED state |

**CLI changes:**

- `lock`: Stage 3 (`_apply_openclaw`) runs after `.env`+DB committed. On
  detected+failed → exit 73, writes sentinel, emits `[FAIL]` block.
- `unlock`: `_apply_openclaw_unlock` runs after key restore. `[OK]` prefix on
  each key restore line.
- `doctor`: `_check_openclaw_section()` checks skill version + provider entries.
  `--fix` reinstalls stale/missing skill.
- `status`: reads sentinel via `read_sentinel()` + `is_partial()`. Emits
  `[WARN]` and exits 73 on DEGRADED state.

### Key design decisions locked in Phase 2

**L1 (unchanged):** OpenClaw stage failures NEVER roll back `.env`/DB. The
`.env` is the binding security contract.

**L2 (revised 2026-05-08):** detected+failed → exit 73 (not exit 0). The
original spec said exit 0; this was revised after the verification gauntlet
showed that a silent success on partial failure destroys user trust. The sentinel
(`last-lock-status.json`) persists the DEGRADED state so `worthless status`
catches it even if the terminal session that ran `lock` was closed.

**L3 (unchanged):** We own `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/worthless/` — overwrite
stale content without prompting.

**Trust-fix exit code 73:** `EX_CANTCREAT` (POSIX). Chosen because it is
distinct from all other worthless exit codes, makes grep-able in CI, and is
semantically close ("can't create the secure state we promised").

### Idempotency guarantee

Both `apply_lock` and `apply_unlock` are idempotent: running them twice produces
the same state as running once. This means `worthless doctor --fix` (which calls
`skill.install()`) and a subsequent `worthless lock` (which calls `apply_lock()`)
compose safely without leaving residue.

### What Phase 2 does NOT include

- Real-container e2e proof (deferred to WOR-432).
- `SKILL.md` content authoring (deferred to Phase 3, separate ticket).
- `worthless openclaw` CLI namespace (deferred by design — see locked decision L6).
- Rolling back `.env`/DB on OpenClaw stage failure (L1 prohibition).

### WOR-321 disposition

WOR-321 ("worthless lock multi-config detection — .env + openclaw.json") is closed
as a duplicate. Its scope (detecting and writing both `.env` and `openclaw.json` in
one lock invocation) is fully delivered by Phase 2.b.
